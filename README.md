Experiments with interactive audio loops in R

Playing with ideas and tools by [https://github.com/coolbutuseless](https://github.com/coolbutuseless).

These experiments in building a small sample sequencer make use of the `eventloop` and `audio` R packages. 

You can install `eventloop` as follows:

```
# install.package('remotes')
remotes::install_github('coolbutuseless/eventloop')
```

Also do follow the guides and examples on the [website](https://coolbutuseless.github.io/2022/05/06/introducing-eventloop-realtime-interactive-rendering-in-r/)
